### Unit Testing
The test suite focuses on verifying the behavior of the Fixed Feedback Rate Controller in isolation. Each test case checks a specific aspect of the controller's functionality:
- Sending transactions at the specified rate
- Stopping transactions when unfinished transactions exceed the threshold
- Resuming transactions after the sleep period

By testing the controller's behavior independently, the unit tests ensure that the core functionality works as expected.

### Integration Testing
The tests also involve integrating the Fixed Feedback Rate Controller with the Caliper framework. The Caliper class is used to manage the test environment, start and stop the tests, and send transactions. This integration testing approach verifies that the controller works correctly within the Caliper ecosystem.

### Testing Methodology
The testing methodology follows a white-box testing approach, where the tests have knowledge of the internal structure and implementation details of the Fixed Feedback Rate Controller. This allows for more targeted and specific test cases.

### Important Decisions
- **Choosing Mocha as the testing framework:** Mocha provides a clear and readable structure for the test suite, making it easier to organize and manage the tests.
- **Using Chai for assertions:** Chai's expect function provides a fluent and expressive syntax for writing assertions, improving the readability and maintainability of the test code.
- **Introducing a sleep period in the third test case:** The 10-second sleep period simulates the actual behavior of the Fixed Feedback Rate Controller, where it stops sending transactions for a certain duration when the unfinished transactions threshold is exceeded.
- **Asserting the number of transactions sent:** The tests use assertions to verify the expected number of transactions sent by the controller. This ensures that the controller behaves as expected under different scenarios.

By combining unit testing and integration testing, the provided code ensures that the Fixed Feedback Rate Controller functions correctly both in isolation and when integrated with the Caliper framework. The testing methodology and decisions made in the code contribute to the overall reliability and maintainability of the testing suite.
